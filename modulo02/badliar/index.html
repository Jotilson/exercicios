            <pre>
    Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
    And terrors don't prey on
    Innocent victims
    Trust me, darling, trust me, darling
    It's been a loveless year
    I'm a man of three fears
    Integrity, faith and
    Crocodile tears
    Trust me, darling, trust me, darling
    So look me in the eyes
    Tell me what you see
    Perfect paradise
    Tearing at the seams
    I wish I could escape
    I don't wanna fake it
    Wish I could erase it
    Make your heart believe
    But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
    Now you know
    Now you know
    I'm a bad liar, bad liar
    Now you know, you're free to go (go)
    Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
    Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
    Oh, I've been askin'
    Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems
    I wage my war, on the world inside
    I take my gun to the enemy's side
    Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
    Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
    Problems, problems, problems
    So look me in the eyes
    Tell me what you see
    Perfect paradise
    Tearing at the seams
    I wish I could escape
    I don't wanna fake it
    Wish I could erase it
    Make your heart believe
    But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
    Now you know
    Now you know
    That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
    Now you know, you're free to go
    I can't breathe, I can't be
    I can't be what you want me to be
    Believe me, this one time
    Believe me
    I'm a bad liar, bad liar
    Now you know
    Now you know
    That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
    Now you know, you're free to go
    Oh
    Please believe me
    Please believe me
